          "user_message": "What could explain a 12% drop in night shift throughput at our Atlanta warehouse last night?",
          "ai_response": "Common causes for throughput drops include:\n- Labor shortages (e.g., absences, shift imbalance)\n- Delays in inbound shipments\n- Equipment or system failures (e.g., scanner downtime, SAP sync issues).\nIf there are known scanner sync issues or late shipments logged during that time, they\u2019re likely contributors."

          "user_message": "Would delayed inbound trucks have more impact at the start or end of a night shift?",
          "ai_response": "More impact at the start of the shift. Late inbound shipments delay initial staging and disrupt the processing pipeline, which can reduce overall throughput for the entire shift."

          "ai_response": "Yes. If inventory movements aren\u2019t scanned into SAP or WMS systems, actual throughput might be underreported. It wouldn\u2019t reflect a real performance dip but a visibility issue."

          "ai_response": "You could cross-reference:\n- Manual pick/pack logs from the floor\n- Actual ship confirmation timestamps\n- Scanner error logs or SAP sync reports\nThis helps confirm whether the system underreported activity."

          "ai_response": "Only if the dashboards visualize both throughput and data latency/errors. If they rely solely on scanned data, they won\u2019t show the discrepancy unless you built in anomaly detection."

          "ai_response": "A practical rule is: no scan events for 15\u201330 mins in an active zone = potential sync or device failure. That\u2019s a common threshold used in logistics dashboards."

          "ai_response": "Plot throughput against staffing levels for past 30 days using a scatter plot or run a simple correlation analysis. If the correlation is strong (r > 0.6), it\u2019s likely a primary driver."

          "ai_response": "Yes. Multiply the delta in order volume by average order value (AOV). For example, if AOV is $180 and 16% of 2,000 daily orders were lost, you\u2019re missing ~$57,600."
